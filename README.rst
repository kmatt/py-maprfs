pymaprfs
=========

hdfs3 is a lightweight Python wrapper for libhdfs3_, a native C/C++ library to interact with the Hadoop File System (HDFS).

pymaprfs is a MapR-compatible library by making some small modifications to the hdfs3 library, wrap MapR's C++ bindings instead of using the libhdfs bindings found in Cloudera or Hortonworks distros.
